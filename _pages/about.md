I am Dr. Lisa Schmors currently a postdoc at the [Hertie Institute for AI in Brain Health](https://hertie.ai/) in Tübingen, Germany.

## Research Interests
I have a Ph.D. at the intersection of Computer Science and Neuroscience from the [International Max Planck Research School for Intelligent Systems](https://imprs.is.mpg.de/). My research focuses on using mathematical models and statistical tools to explore how the brain represents and processes information. My primary focus revolves around analyzing brain data to gain a comprehensive understanding of neuronal functioning at both the single-cell and circuit levels. This spans essential aspects of brain function such as feedforward and feedback processing, as well as examining how information is represented across various neuronal cell types.

Motivated by a deep curiosity for the intricacies of the brain, including the formation of thoughts and the perception of sensory information, I did a Bachelor's degree in Biology, specializing in Neurobiology and Biotechnology at the Free University of Berlin. I then did a Master's in Neuroscience at the University of Oldenburg. During this time, I had the opportunity to complete two research interships at the Department of Computer Science ,(University of Copenhagen, Denmark) under the guidance of Christian Igel and the Department of Theoretical Neuroscience (University of Waterloo, Canada) supervised by Terrence C. Stewart and Chris Eliasmith. These experiences deepened my interdisciplinary and international perspective on neuroscience.
