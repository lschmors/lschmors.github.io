On June 5th, 2025, I had the pleasure of presenting at the **Science Slam - AI Edition** as part of *Tübingen Talks Tech*. Doctoral candidates and postdocs from the University of Tübingen shared their research in entertaining 10-minute talks for a general audience.

## Thalamus Thought Traffic

In my talk **"Thalamus Thought Traffic"**, I explored how machine learning can help us understand complex computations in the brain and, vice versa, how insights from neuroscience can inspire the development of more robust AI algorithms.

The event was a fantastic opportunity to step outside the lab and communicate science in a fun and accessible way. Science slams are a great reminder that the stories behind our research matter just as much as the results.

## About the Event

The Science Slam – AI Edition was organized by the **Tübingen AI PhD und Postdoc Assembly (TAPPA)** and supported by:
- The Excellence Cluster *Machine Learning: New Perspectives for Science*
