During the week of August 17–22, 2025, I attended the [Deep Learning Indaba](https://deeplearningindaba.com) in Kigali, Rwanda. I was invited as a keynote speaker and panelist at the NeuroAI workshop, where I presented my latest research on contrastive learning for neural time series data.

Established in 2017, the Indaba has grown to become the largest annual machine learning and artificial intelligence conference on the African continent. This year's conference operated under the motto **"Urunana"** — meaning *"hand in hand"* in Kinyarwanda. The theme emphasizes the strength of community and the importance of coming together to collaboratively shape the future of AI, both between African nations and the global community, and between industry and academia.

The conference hosted workshops, covering topics such as "Data Science for Health in Africa," "Robotics," and "TrustAI." The **NeuroAI** workshop, where I had the privilege of presenting, explored the exciting intersections between neuroscience and artificial intelligence.
