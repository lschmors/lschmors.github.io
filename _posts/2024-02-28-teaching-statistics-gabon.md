In February 2024, I had the opportunity to teach statistics at the Centre de Recherches Médicales de Lambaréné (CERMEL) in Gabon, Africa. This course is part of a Master's program in "Infection Biology and Control" in collaboration with the University of Tübingen. The program aims to equip students from West and Central Africa with the skills needed to address infectious disease challenges in sub-Saharan Africa.

The history of CERMEL dates back to 1913, starting with the first Albert Schweitzer Hospital in Lambaréné. Today, it also includes a research laboratory focusing on malaria and other tropical diseases. Despite the challenges here in Lambaréné, such as its humid 33-degree climate and occasional lack of water and electricity, the dedication of everyone on campus is remarkable.

The commitment of the 15 master students impressed me deeply. Their motivation to learn and understand complex topics in mathematical modeling and biostatistics, essential for researching infectious diseases, was truly inspiring. I have no doubts that they will be the next generation of highly skilled African researchers who will successfully tackle the global challenges of future infectious diseases.
