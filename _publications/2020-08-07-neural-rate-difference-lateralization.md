## Abstract
Lateralization of complex high-frequency sounds is conveyed by interaural level differences (ILDs) and interaural time differences (ITDs) in the envelope. In this work, an auditory model was constructed to simulate data from three previous behavioral studies obtained with, in total, over 1000 different amplitude-modulated stimuli. A well-established auditory periphery model was combined with a functional count-comparison model for binaural excitatory-inhibitory (EI) interaction. After parameter optimization of the EI-model stage, the hemispheric rate-difference between pairs of EI-model neurons relates linearly with the extent of laterality in human listeners. If a certain ILD and a certain envelope ITD each cause a similar extent of laterality, they also produce a similar rate difference in the same model neurons. After parameter optimization, the model accounts for 95.7% of the variance in the largest dataset, in which amplitude modulation depth, rate of modulation, modulation exponent, ILD, and envelope ITD were varied. The model also accounts for 83% of the variances in each of the other two datasets using the same EI model parameters.
